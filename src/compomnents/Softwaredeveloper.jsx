This includes assessing the project's scope, the intended users, and the resources needed for the development process. The analysis stage then entails collecting and analyzing data in order to pinpoint user requirements and produce a comprehensive project schedule. Use cases, process flows, and other types of documentation are often created during this stage to specify the functional and non-functional requirements of the software programme.</p>

Writing the code and creating the software application in accordance with the design specifications constitute the implementation step. To make sure the software application satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements, this entails developing, testing, and debugging. The software application is then continually updated, supported, and monitored during the maintenance stage to make sure it continues to function properly and meet user needs.</p>
